/**
 @brief Wrapper class for object which should be passed along with context. item to one of
        CoreFoundation functinos.
 
 @discussion Help to wrap and manage memory usage by object which should be added into context.
             It is possible that object from context has been released at the same time when 
             callback will try to gain access to the object. Wrapper will try to use \c weak
             reference which will protect code from accessing released object.
