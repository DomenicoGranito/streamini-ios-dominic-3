 @brief De-serialize HTTP raw data from provided read buffer.
 
 @param buffer               Reference on read buffer from which data should be de-serialized.
 @param parseCompletionBlock Data processing completion block. Block pass four parameters:
                             \c responses - list of response objects retrieved from read buffer;
                             \c fullBufferLength - full read buffer size; 
                             \c processedBufferLength - how much of bytes from read buffer has 
                             been processed; \c readBufferPostProcessing - read buffer post 
                             processing block which should be called by caller to notify about
                             de-serialization completion.
